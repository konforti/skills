Rules for adding or changing skills in this repo. The `skills` CLI is unforgiving
about layout and frontmatter: a skill that breaks these rules is dropped from
discovery with no warning, so read this before opening a PR.

## Layout

Every skill lives at `skills/<category>/<name>/SKILL.md`, exactly two directories
deep. The CLI does not look any deeper, so a skill nested at depth three is
invisible to users.

Categories:

- `platform` — reference skills for a Cloudinary capability (uploads,
  transformations, docs lookup)
- `frameworks` — patterns for using Cloudinary in a specific framework or SDK
- `use-cases` — end-to-end recipes that combine several capabilities
- `utilities` — tools that do a job using Cloudinary

Category directories are created with their first skill. Do not add a README or
placeholder to an empty category.

Users install skills by name, not by path, so the category is invisible to them.
Moving a skill between categories does not affect existing installs.

## Frontmatter

```yaml
---
name: cloudinary-example
description: "Reference for <capability>. Use when <trigger phrases>."
license: MIT
metadata:
  author: cloudinary
  version: '1.0.0'
---
```

- `name` must equal the directory name.
- `name` and `description` must both be strings. If either is missing, or the
  frontmatter fails to parse, the skill silently vanishes from discovery.
- A description containing a colon must be quoted. Unquoted, YAML reads the colon
  as a nested key, the description is no longer a string, and the skill vanishes.
- Include `license`, `metadata.author`, and `metadata.version` (semver).
- Set `metadata.internal: true` on a work-in-progress skill that should not appear
  in the default install. Users can reveal it with `INSTALL_INTERNAL_SKILLS=1`.

## Description shapes

Agents see the catalog as a flat list of names and descriptions, so every
description does two jobs. It opens with a clause that self-locates the skill in
that list, then follows with a "Use when..." sentence that carries the trigger
phrases.

| Category | Opening shape |
|---|---|
| Platform | `Reference for <capability>.` |
| Frameworks | `Patterns for using Cloudinary in <framework>.` |
| Use-case | `End-to-end recipe for <outcome>.` |
| Utility | `Tool that <does X> using Cloudinary.` |

Rules:

- The opening clause never contains a colon before its first period unless the
  whole description is quoted.
- Trigger phrases live in the "Use when" sentence, not in the opening clause.

Existing skills predate these shapes and are not yet retrofitted. New skills must
follow them.

## Referencing other skills

Refer to another skill by its name only, for example "use cloudinary-docs for
anything outside this skill's scope". Never reference another skill by file path.
Installed paths differ per agent and per install scope, so a path that works on
your machine will be wrong on someone else's.

## Versioning

Bump `metadata.version` on any content change to a skill, including its
references and assets. Moving or renaming files with identical content does not
bump the version; the lock-file hash is unchanged and `skills update` correctly
reports nothing to do. CI enforces this on every PR: a skill with changed
content and an unchanged version fails the `versions` job.

## Documentation links

Every link to a Cloudinary docs `.md` page or `llms.txt` must carry
`?install_source=skillspack&referrer=<skill>-skill` so traffic from skills is
attributable. Use the same `referrer` value throughout a skill, for example
`trans-skill` or `react-skill`. CI fails the `links` job on any link missing
either param.

## Local check

Before opening a PR, run the same checks CI runs:

```bash
scripts/check-discovery.sh
scripts/check-links.sh
scripts/check-versions.sh origin/main HEAD
```

The discovery script compares the `name` in every `SKILL.md` under `skills/`
against the names the skills CLI actually lists, and names any skill that is
missing. A missing skill means it is being dropped: check for bad frontmatter,
an unquoted colon in the description, a missing `name` or `description`, or a
directory nested at the wrong depth. The other two scripts report any untracked
doc link (and fail if they find no links at all) and any changed skill whose
version was not bumped. CI (`.github/workflows/skills-discovery.yml`) runs all
three and fails the PR on the same conditions.
